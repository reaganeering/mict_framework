## Overview

The MICT (Mobius Inspired Cyclical Transformation) Framework is a JavaScript library for building adaptive, intelligent systems. It provides a structured, iterative process for managing state, handling events, and implementing complex logic. Inspired by the Mobius strip and principles of continuous learning, MICT enables the creation of applications that can adapt to changing conditions and improve their performance over time. This is the core logic engine.

## Key Features

*   **Cyclical Process:** Implements the core MICT cycle (Mapping, Iteration, Checking, Transformation).
*   **Flexible Configuration:**  Allows you to define custom stages, initial state, and stage functions.
*   **State Management:**  Provides clear mechanisms for managing the state of your system.
*   **Asynchronous Support:**  Handles asynchronous operations within stage functions.
*   **Error Handling:**  Includes built-in error handling and the ability to define custom error handlers.
*   **Lightweight and Modular:**  Easy to integrate into existing projects.
*   **Well-Documented:**  Includes comprehensive JSDoc comments for easy understanding and use.
*   **Open Source:**  Released under the [Boredbrains Consortium License](LICENSE.txt).
